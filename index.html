<h2>About Me</h2>
</center>
<p align="left">
 I am currently a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy at Vassar College. Starting in fall 2024, I will be an assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy at Haverford College.  </p>

<p align="left">
I received my PhD from the University of Notre Dame in August 2020. My research focuses on logic, philosophy of logic, and philosophy of mathematics. Much of my current work examines the nature of translation, equivalence, and reduction using tools from formal logic (especially contemporary model theory). I also have serious research interests in the philosophy of science and the history of 19th and 20th century philosophy (both Continental and Analytic traditions). Outside of philosophy, I'm passionate about <a class="nav" href="prisoneducation.html">
	   prison education</a> and translating Vietnamese poetry.</p>


<p align="left"> My current projects include papers on:

<li align="left"> A model-theoretic approach to logicism: a case study on Zilber's conjecture.
<li align="left"> Bi-interpretability as a notion of theoretical equivalence.
<li align="left"> Hermann Weyl's influence on Heidegger's philosophy.
<li align="left"> Tran Duc Thao's critique of Husserlian phenomenology.
